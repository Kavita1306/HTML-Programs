    <h2>India among countries with most Android malware, ‘GB WhatsApp’ among responsible apps: ESET report</h2>
    <p>As cybersecurity threats around the world decrease post COVID, a new ESET report suggests the situation is still not very good in India, which happens to be one of the largest playgrounds for Android malware. <br><br>A new report has suggested that India is among the countries with the most Android infections. The T2 2022 Threat Report by Malware protection and Internet Security firm ESET suggests that India was among countries with most detections of Android/ Spy Agent Trojan malware as Android threat detections continued to grow in T2 2022 by 9.5 per cent.
    <br>These trojan agents are malware files or code that arrive on a target device undetected, often blended with or disguised as another app and then spy on the target devices, with capabilities going as far as secretly recording audio and video.
<br></p><b>‘GB WhatsApp’ responsible among responsible apps</b>
<br>The report adds that third-party WhatsApp client/clone GB WhatsApp, which offers its users all of WhatsApp’s standard features along with some added benefits, was responsible for a large portion of Android spyware detection in the last four months.</p>

    <h2>Apple’s record Euro 1.1 billion French antitrust fine slashed by 66 per cent</h2>
    <p>Apple won a €728 million-euro ($715 million) reduction to the record €1.1 billion penalty it was hit with in 2020 for anti-competitive agreements with two favored distributors.<br><br>The Paris court of appeals reduced Apple’s total fine on Thursday to about €371.6 million after judges decided to trim the duration of one of the infringements and lower the increases applied to the penalty that took into account the firm’s economic power.<br>“The 90% multiple is disproportionate,” the court said in its ruling. “A 50% multiple is sufficient to guarantee that the penalties are repressive and dissuasive.”

        France’s competition arm has kept a close eye on Silicon Valley firm in recent years. Last year, Google was fined €500 million for failing to follow an order to thrash out fair deals with news publishers. The California tech giant then settled on the substance of that case to avoid further fines but had previously received hefty penalties in separate cases. Meta similarly clinched an agreement earlier this year to steer clear of fines after making pledges concerning the online advertising market.</p>
